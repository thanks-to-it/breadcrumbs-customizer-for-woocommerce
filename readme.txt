Customize the WooCommerce breadcrumbs. Beautifully.

== Description ==

**ZILI Breadcrumbs Customizer for WooCommerce** is a lightweight plugin that lets you customize the WooCommerce breadcrumbs.

ZILI Breadcrumbs Customizer for WooCommerce is a straightforward yet efficient plugin that grants you complete control over the look of your WooCommerce breadcrumbs.

Easily modify the HTML encompassing the breadcrumbs to explore different styling options, changing from the default link representation with separator characters to perhaps an unsorted list of links, and even availing the option to disable them altogether.

### 🚀 Customizable Delimiter for Breadcrumbs ###

Enhance the visual layout of your WooCommerce breadcrumbs by setting a custom delimiter.

The plugin allows you to replace the default `/` with any character or symbol of your choice, enabling a seamless integration of the breadcrumbs with your site's design and style.

### 🚀 Advanced HTML Wrapping Options ###

Add a personalized touch to your breadcrumbs with custom HTML before and after the entire breadcrumb trail.

Have the flexibility to wrap your breadcrumbs in specific HTML elements, for better structure and styling alignment with your website's theme.

### 🚀 Detailed Breadcrumb Element Customization ###

Fine-tune each breadcrumb element with options to insert HTML before and after individual breadcrumbs and enhance each segment of the breadcrumb trail, making a more engaging and informative navigation experience for users.

### 🚀 Change "Home" in Breadcrumb Title & URL ###

The plugin allows you to change the default "Home" title to any text that fits your site's context, to better align with your site's branding or user expectations.

### 🚀 Hide Breadcrumbs Completely ###

The plugin includes the functionality to completely hide the breadcrumb trail for a cleaner and more minimalistic page layout.

This feature is useful for pages where breadcrumb navigation might not be necessary or could distract from the main content.
